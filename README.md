# MP1A Group 8

Unity VR project for CS 417.

## Parking lot decorations

`SampleScene` includes a `Parking Lot Decorations` prefab with eight parking bays,
lane markings, a crosswalk, four planted trees, an attendant cottage, three people,
a bench, street lamps, a parking sign, bollards, and a litter bin. The center aisle
remains open and the original car stays in place.

Edit `mp1a/Assets/Decorations/ParkingLot.prefab` to move or recolor individual props.
The decorations are static visual objects; the original floor provides collision.
They are visible in Edit mode and Play mode without adding a component or running
a generator. If the scene was already open when the files changed, reload
`Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity` from disk to see the new prefab instance.

## Controls

| Action | XR controller | XR simulator keyboard | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quit | Right-hand primary button | `1` | Plays the farewell cue, waits for it to finish, then stops Play mode or quits the build. |
| Toggle blood moon | Right-hand secondary button | `2` | Toggles between the original scene lighting and a dim, dark-red light. Press again to restore the original color and intensity. |
| Switch view location | Left-hand primary button | `Shift + 1` | Alternates between the room and the external viewing point and plays a small doorway fog puff. |
| Shoot ball | Left-hand secondary button | `Shift + 2` | Spawns a ball in front of the left controller, projects that controller's aim onto an orbital tangent and launches it at `sqrt(gravity / distance)`, and plays spatial sound and a particle burst there. Planet gravity bends its path afterward. |

## Input setup

- Quit uses `ControllerSampleActions/RightHand/PrimaryButton`.
- Blood moon lighting uses `ControllerSampleActions/RightHand/SecondaryButton`. The scene starts with its original lighting; the Point Light's LightSwitch component exposes Blood Moon Color and Blood Moon Intensity Multiplier for tuning (default 65% intensity).
- The blood moon toggle plays existing ParticleSystem components saved in the hierarchy. Expand `planet > Planet Clouds`, `planet > moon > Moon Clouds`, and `comet > Comet Clouds`. Expand each tree and person under `Parking Lot Decorations` to find its `Blood Moon Burst` child. Each Street lamp also has a `Crimson Sparks` child; Parking attendant cottage has `Left Window Mist`, `Right Window Mist`, and `Doorway Fog` children.
- Edit each child's Particle System directly: Main controls lifetime/size/color, Emission controls burst count/rate, Shape controls spread, and Renderer controls the material. The three clouds loop; the seven tree/person emitters have one 28-particle burst, no continuous emission, and lifetimes of 0.35–0.8 seconds. The two lamps use 8 sparks each (0.5-second lifetime); the two windows use 10 mist particles each (1.4 seconds); the doorway uses 12 pale fog particles (1.6 seconds). All five new emitters are non-looping, have zero emission rate, and use one burst. All emitters have Play On Awake disabled.
- `BloodMoonEffects` on Point Light only holds Clouds and Bursts references and calls Play/Stop. It creates no objects, materials, or particle settings at runtime. Turning normal lighting back on clears every effect. Stop Play and reload `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity` after this migration to see the saved children and new references.
- Gameplay actions bind only to XR controller buttons. The former direct `1`–`4` keyboard shortcuts are removed so they do not conflict with simulator input.
- The imported XR Interaction Simulator automatically starts in the Editor only. Enter Play mode and focus the Game window. In controller simulation, use `1` / `2` for the right controller's primary / secondary buttons; hold `Shift` for the left controller (`Shift + 1` / `Shift + 2`).
- Use `Tab` for device mode and `[` to manipulate the left controller. Keep it in Controller mode rather than Hand mode when testing these buttons. `3` / `4` now retain their simulator meaning (joystick clicks).

## Side Quests

- Particle Feedback Content: sixteen input-triggered emitters total: one shooting burst, three celestial clouds, four tree bursts, three person bursts, two lamp sparks, two window mists, and one doorway puff. The first fourteen environmental emitters use the blood moon toggle; the doorway uses view switching; shooting has its own action. This reaches the rubric's sixteen-emitter threshold (3 points), subject to acceptance of multiple emitters sharing one input.

- [x] Object Shooter: each spawned ball stores its own velocity and adds it to its position every `Update` using `Time.deltaTime`. Its initial direction comes from the left controller, with the radial component removed as permitted by Perfect Orbits. Gravity updates its stored velocity continuously.
- [x] Arbitrary Orbiter: the comet's double integrator calculates acceleration from the live position of the assigned planet Transform rather than a hardcoded world-space point.
- [x] Perfect Orbits: launch velocity is tangent to the attractor and has magnitude `sqrt(gravity / distance)`. Directly radial aim uses the controller's up direction as the fallback tangent. Gravity continues every Update using semi-implicit Euler substeps of at most 1/120 second; orbits are numerical approximations.

To verify Object Shooter in the XR simulator, select the left controller and aim it
away from the headset's forward direction. Shoot and check that the ball starts
just ahead of that controller and travels along the tangent closest to its aim, then curves around the planet.
A directly inward/outward aim instead uses the controller-up fallback tangent. Rotating only the headset should not change the launch direction when
the controller's world rotation stays fixed. FPS/point-and-click simulation may
move the controller with the mouse, so inspect the left controller pose separately.

Blood moon visual check: enter Play mode with the Game window focused. Initially
there should be no clouds or droplet bursts. Press simulator `2`: all three bodies
should gain wispy red clouds, while the four trees and three people each flash a
short dark-red droplet burst. The droplets should fade within 0.8 seconds without looping. Watch the
moon and comet move to check that the clouds follow them. Press `2` again: particles
clear immediately and the original room light returns. Repeat
several times to confirm the hierarchy does not accumulate additional effects.

To check the added feedback, press simulator `2` to see lamp sparks and window mist. Press `Shift + 1` to switch views and trigger the doorway puff. All emitters are saved in the hierarchy; no particle objects are created at runtime.

## Spatial audio

All 16 AudioSources are saved in the hierarchy, with Spatial Blend 1, Play On Awake off, no looping, and distance attenuation. Used clips in `Assets/sound_effect` import as mono with preloaded audio data; the original MP3 files are unchanged. `SpatialSoundFeedback` on Point Light holds the source references and routes the existing gameplay events.

| Sources | Location | Trigger / clips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Planet children | Normal: chime; blood moon: rumble |
| 2 | Moon children | Normal: bell1; blood moon: bell2 at lower pitch |
| 2 | Comet children | Whoosh, higher pitch for normal and lower for blood moon |
| 3 | One Startled Gasp child per person | gasp1 / gasp2 / gasp3 when blood moon begins |
| 2 | Car children | car_beep on normal shots; lower-pitched horn on blood moon shots |
| 2 | Spatial Audio Feedback group | Departure at the previous listener position; arrival at the new position when switching views |
| 1 | Spatial Audio Feedback / Welcome - First Input | Welcome traveler once on the first light toggle, view switch, or successful shot |
| 1 | Spatial Audio Feedback / Farewell - Before Quit | bye before quitting, with a clip-length delay |
| 1 | shooting_ball_sound | fireball on each successful shot |

The six body sources follow their moving objects. Gasps stop when normal mode returns, and switching modes stops the opposite body cues. The two car horns are mutually exclusive. Welcome, farewell, and teleport sources are placed in world space near the listener when triggered, rather than remaining parented to the headset. `car_drop.mp3` is not used for these cues.

Stop Play, allow the audio imports to finish, and reload SampleScene before testing the new references. Listen while turning your head to check direction and adjust each source's Volume in the Inspector as needed. The voice identities of gasp1-3 have not been confirmed by listening; swap clips between the person AudioSources if necessary.

Spatial Sound Content: 16 separate input-triggered spatial audio generators, meeting the rubric's 16-generator threshold (3 points).
